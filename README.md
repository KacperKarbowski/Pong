"Pong" is a classic video game inspired by table tennis, designed in the early years of computer gaming. In this single-player version, you control a paddle using the W (up) and S (down) keys, aiming to bounce the ball off the paddle's surface. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points against the computer-controlled opponent.

Gameplay is straightforward:

    1.Paddle Movement: You control a paddle that moves vertically along the game's side. Use the W key to move the paddle up and the S key to move it down.

    2.Game Start: The game begins with the ball positioned in the middle of the playfield, and you get ready to serve.

    3.Serve: To initiate play, the ball is served from the center, and you need to hit it with your paddle to start the rally.

    4.Ball Bouncing: Your goal is to keep the ball from passing your paddle by hitting it with the paddle's surface. The ball bounces off the walls and your paddle.

    5.Scoring Points: You score a point when the ball passes the opponent's paddle and hits the background behind it. Scoring points might result in the opponent's paddle moving closer to their end.

    6.Continuation: After scoring or serving, the ball returns to the center, and the game continues.

    7.Winning: The game is played until you or the opponent reaches a predefined number of points (typically 11 or 21) here 2. The first to reach this number wins the match.

This single-player adaptation of "Pong" retains the minimalistic nature and simple rules of the original while providing an engaging experience as you compete against a computer opponent. Your skill in controlling the paddle's movement will determine your success in preventing the ball from getting past you and securing victory.
